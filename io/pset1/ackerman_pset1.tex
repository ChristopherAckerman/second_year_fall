\subsection*{Mean own-price elasticities from the estimates in models 1--3}

\begin{table}

  \end{table}

These results make sense. As a rule of thumb, the own-price elasticities should be $\in (-2, -5)$. The IV estimates using the Hausman instrument are approximately in this range. The OLS estimates are not, indicating that endogeneity is a practical concern in this setting. The estimates with wholesale cost as an instrument are also ``too small'', indicating that wholesale cost may not be a viable instrument in this context.
