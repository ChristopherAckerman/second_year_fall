\begin{frame}{Overview}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item BLP looks at demand for cars at a single point in time.
    \vitem This is an extension, and has more detailed data (second choice product choices).
    \vitem Also looks at consumer welfare, and how consumer surplus has changed over time.
    \vitem Even though prices have gone up, consumers are better off and are capturing more total surplus, largely due to higher quality cars.
